			<td>She is my favorite character in the whole series, from Season 1 all the way up to 3. She may be one of the protagonists, but her character is very strong. It was the first time I had so much rage for a fictional character. Her actress is very good, acted and expressed the emotions and words very well. Her character may be evil, but I love the character improvement as the series goes on. She is also my first ever favorite protagonist.</td>
